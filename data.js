  "what is ai waste separator": [
    "AI Waste Separator is a smart system that uses sensors and AI to detect and separate waste into categories automatically.",
    "Itâ€™s an intelligent bin that identifies the type of waste using camera and AI algorithms, sorting it into correct compartments.",
    "A device powered by machine learning to classify waste as organic, plastic, or metal and sort them automatically."
  ],
  "how it works": [
    "When waste is detected, a camera scans it, and AI identifies the material type using image recognition. Then, servo motors move it to the correct bin.",
    "The system uses image capture, AI prediction, and motor control to separate different types of waste without human help.",
    "It works using sensors and neural networks that visually analyze the object and trigger a sorting mechanism."
  ],
  "objectives": [
    "The goal is to automate waste sorting, reduce human risk, and promote recycling efficiency.",
    "Objectives include smart segregation, safety improvement, and better waste tracking via IoT.",
    "It aims to make waste management easier, faster, and cleaner using AI and automation."
  ],
  "advantages": [
    "It automates segregation, promotes hygiene, and increases recycling rates.",
    "Advantages include speed, safety, and reduced landfill waste.",
    "It helps the environment, saves time, and prevents workers from touching harmful materials."
  ],
  "future scope": [
    "Future versions may include voice interaction, reward systems, and better recognition models.",
    "It could integrate with smart city data and use large language models for advanced reasoning.",
    "Next-gen models can learn new waste types and connect directly to recycling centers."
  ],
  "materials": [
    "Camera, Raspberry Pi, sensors, servo motors, compartments, and power source.",
    "AI model, camera module, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and control board.",
    "Basic materials include image sensor, processor, and 3D-printed bin."
  ],
  "hypothesis": [
    "AI can automatically identify and segregate waste based on visual features.",
    "Machine learning can recognize waste materials accurately for smart disposal.",
    "The assumption is that AI can replace manual segregation effectively."
  ],
  "introduction": [
    "Waste is increasing rapidly. Manual sorting is unsafe. AI-based solutions can help automate the process.",
    "In modern cities, waste handling is a challenge. AI Waste Separator offers a clean, smart approach.",
    "To handle growing waste efficiently, AI technology can make segregation automated and precise."
